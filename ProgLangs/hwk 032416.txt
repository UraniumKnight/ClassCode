q 2:  Could something fail to find a storage spot?

No - anything that our interpreter looks up it has to have obtained from somewhere within our environment or store, meaning that it exists and we know it exists.

q 3:  What changes need to be made to limit storage to only boxes?

Every time something is put in storage, see if it's a box.  If not, wrap it in a box, and then put it in the storage.
